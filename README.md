Wow, just come out of Kesari Chapter 2, and lemme tell you, my head's still spinning. It's like sitting in a tornado — the loud kinda rustling one, not the quiet twirls. Crazy. My back's in knots from those seats — feels like I was riding a camel, dunno why they can't make seats comfy. Anyway, popcorn crumbs on my lap still here, reminder of the chaos.

You know that scene when they re-create the protests before Jallianwala Bagh? Man, the noise in the theater was only half of what it must've been like, but wow, it hits you. It's like being stuck in an elevator with a marching band. The colors, the roars — it's like a visual curry, spicy and a bit too much, but soooomehow you can't stop dunking naan in the gravy.

> Then there's that guy who reminded me of my uncle back in Punjab, just his way of standing — you could feel his conviction through the screen. Seriously, it’s like he was a tree. Swaying gently but rooted, so strong. One moment you’re feeling like pac-man getting swallowed by emotions, the next, you’re giggling because someone in the crowd sneezes so deeply, sounded kinda like a munchkin.

Thinking you shouuuuuld probably download the movie later or might just wait and watch the movie on a bigger screen. Though, the first-hand vibe just can't be matched.

They had this wild cinematography going, transitions smoother than I'd ever spread cold butter on bread, which frankly always ends up torn, but nah, not these scenes. Seamless. Emotional. Those eyes tell more stories than my grandma on a rainy night.

My friend, can't quite piece together how they managed to meld chaos into something that felt like music — albeit the kind you'd play if you wanna freak out your cat. Ever tried that? Cats racing up walls.

Somewhere in all this thinking, forgot to mention - the music, a whole different beast! Its like trying to catch a slippery fish with hands already full of truths. It keeps wiggling away just when you think you’ve caught the essence.
